👋 Hi, I’m @jalzoren
👀 I’m interested in web development, UI/UX design, and graphic design. I love creating visually appealing and functional user interfaces while ensuring a smooth user experience. Additionally, I have a passion for back-end development and database management, making sure that applications are both aesthetically pleasing and highly efficient.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about front-end and back-end web development, refining my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Vue. On the back end, I’m exploring databases, server-side logic, and API integration to build dynamic and scalable applications. I’m also diving deeper into UI/UX principles to enhance user interactions.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to web designs and ui/ux projects. 

📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via email or connect with me here on GitHub. I’m always open to networking, learning from others, and contributing to exciting projects.
