# Hi, I’m @jalzoren!
I’m into **Web Development**, **UI/UX Design**, and **Graphic Design**. I enjoy creating clean, user-friendly interfaces that also work smoothly behind the scenes.

## Right now, I’m learning more about **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **VBNet**, **C++** and modern frameworks. I’m also exploring **Back-End Development**, **Databases**, and **APIs** to build full-stack applications. Plus, I’m diving deeper into **UI/UX** to improve user experience.

### I’m open to collaborating on **Web Design** and **UI/UX** projects.

Reach me by email or message me here on GitHub. I’d love to connect, learn, and work on cool ideas together!

Pronouns: **He/Him**
